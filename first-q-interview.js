What are the props in react ?

//  Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. props stands for properties.

What do you mean by SPA in react?

//   Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that does not use the default method of loading new pages completely. Instead, it takes new data from the webserver by interacting with the web browser and refreshes the current web page. 

 Examples of SPA , MPA ?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Single-page application (SPA) examples

// <!-- Using an e-mail platform keeps you on the same page even you are reading or writing new e-mails. Accessing photos, writing comments or messages, and viewing profiles on a social media platform won’t determine URLs changes.

// Sounds familiar?

// I bet it does. Most popular social media and e-mail platforms are developed as SPAs. -->


Multi-page application (MPA) examples

// MPAs are great choices. especially for large companies that need online stores, business sites, catalogs, and marketplaces.

// In our portfolio, you can find several types of apps developed by companies from this category.



 What is the best between SPA and MPA ? //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The benefits of developing a single-page application
 
// outstanding UX – native-like experience;
// no page reloads – one session for loading all the resources;
// speed load and instant access to all the features;
// linear & straightforward experience;
// cached data for providing offline use;
// fast development & minimal testing;
// (partial) reusable code;
// relies on modern frameworks (React, Vue.js, AngularJS);


The pitfalls of developing a single-page application

// <!-- SEO limitations – while SPAs do not rely on separate and optimized URLs, search engines cannot read the content (If the app is used for private use, like an intranet, SEO limitations won’t affect you);
// page performance tracking – it’s more difficult to access web statistics and identify performant vs non-performant pages;
// long downloading time – if the app is too complex and poorly optimized;
// single-step experience – no “go back” options without leaving the app;
// JavaScript dependency – enabled JS in the browser is a must – without it, the app usability is limited. -->


The benefits of developing a multi-page application

// <!-- control over SEO – more ranking opportunities for different keywords and optimized URLs;
// scalability – multi-page apps can be extended as much as it’s needed (new features, new content, etc.);
// tracking pages performance can be done easily in analytics;
// differentiate UX – providing multiple pages for different types of content and features, MPAs can provide a wider and page-specific UX. -->


The pitfalls of developing a multi-page application

// every interaction requests several reloads for most of the resources (HTML, CSS, scripts);

// the multiple reloading processes reduce speed and performance;

// complex and time-consuming development – for both back-end and front-end;

// challenging maintenance – each page must be secured and maintained.
